Extraction of Data
For our ETL project, we used two sources of data that were from Kaggle.com 
The data sources were titled Where it Pays to Attend College, which had three csv files:Degrees that pay back, salaries by college type, 
and salaries by region. However, for our project we only used the two csv files: salaries by college type and salaries by region. 
We also, used a JSON file regarding school information called schoolInfo.json regarding statastics surrounding 311 US universities. 
•	https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries#salaries-by-region.csv
•	https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries#salaries-by-college-type.csv
•	https://www.kaggle.com/theriley106/university-statistics

 Transformation of Data
In order to import the two csv files and the single json file, Jupyter notebook was used. The Pandas pd.read_csv and pd.read_json methods 
were used to import the source data files and convert them into pandas dataframes for further processing. Our original files: 
salaries-by-region csv file had 320 rows, the json file had 311 rows, and salaries-by-college-type had 269 rows. 

•	Cleaning of Data
First, we read and dropped the unnecessary columns keeping only school names, city, state, high school gpa, sat average in the schoolInfo.json. Second, read the salaries-by-college-type.csv and salaries-by-region.csv file. Finally, we performed an inner join on these data frames merging into one data frame called clean_df. We further continued to drop the unnecessary columns keeping only school name, state, high school GPA, region, starting median salary, Mid career 10th percentile salary, Mid career 25th percentile salary, Mid career 75th percentile salary, Mid career 90th percentile salary. 
Pandas were used for the data cleaning process. 

One of the challenges for this project were the names of the universities were not standardized. Therefore, the parentheses and text 
within it. Changing the ‘-’ to ‘--’ and   ‘,’ to ‘--’.  We re-named existing columns by removing spaces in column names to be used in 
SQL database. The salary fields were in the string format, so it needed to be converted into floats. This would help the user to query 
the information easily and/or perform functions. So, we dropped $ signs and commas from the amounts. This would create floats as a result. 
Some of the high school GPA values were 'NaN' values, so we decided to fill them with using the  median value of 3.6. 


Loading Database
The relational database of MYSQL was used for our project. The ORM SQLAlchemy for Python was used to communicate with the MYSQL database. 
We created database  ETLProject and used university as the table name into MYSQL. We uploaded the scheme file which contains only 1 table.
